### HEY, Iâ€™M SAM ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m living the dream.

Iâ€™ve always been a great problem solver, and a technophile obsessed with the latest devices. Today, Iâ€™m working from home as a software engineer for BoardPAC (Pvt) Ltd, and I am getting into Amazon Web Services on my own time. 

Familiar with a variety of programming languages, including JavaScript, Python and React, but Iâ€™m always adding new skills to my repertoire. Iâ€™m also eager to meet other software engineers in the area, so feel free to connect!|
